## Documentation

Below are some diagrams which we drew up in the initial stages of the application during our daily standup. It helped us to create a basic outline of the project and we used it as a guide to get us up and running.

Furthermore we had created a wiki page to help us document our work (link found below) which would in the show how much we had learned and accomplished throughout the project.
